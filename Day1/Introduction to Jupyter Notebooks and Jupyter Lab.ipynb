    "- they keep your code and related explanations together. This makes them an excellent platform to share your analysis with your lab and collaborators\n",
    "- you can even call shell commands from within the notebook allowing you to install necessary libraries\n",
    "- you can do interactive visualizations\n",
    "- you can even present your entire notebook or a sample of it as presentation!\n",
