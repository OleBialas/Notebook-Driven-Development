    "Data science notebooks are powerful tools for researchers bacause \n",
    "\n",
    "- they make interactive coding possible\n",
    "- they support many programming languages like Python, R, Julia, etc\n",
    "- they keep your code and related explanations together. This makes them an excellent platform to share your analysis with your lab and collaborators\n",
    "- you can even call shell commands from within the notebook allowing you to install necessary libraries\n",
    "- you can do interactive visualizations\n",
    "- you can even present your entire notebook or a sample of it as presentation!\n",
    "\n",
    "We will work with one such data science notebook called Jupyter notebooks on a web-based development environment called Jupyter Lab. Jupyter lab's interface lets you browse your files and folders, work with terminals, jupyter notebooks, and scripts. "
