    "- **Code cell**: Here, whatever you type will be executed as code.\r\n",
    "- **Markdown cell**: Whatever you type here will be treated as text.\r\n",

    "\r\n",
    "1. **Add Cell (+)** (red arrow pointing to it):\r\n",
    "    - This icon is used to insert a new cell below the currently selected cell. In Jupyter Notebooks, a new cell can be used to either write code or text (Markdown).\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "2. **Run Cell (Right Arrow/Play Icon)**:\r\n",
    "    - This icon runs the currently selected cell. If it contains code, it will execute the code and display the output directly below the cell.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "3. **Cell Type Dropdown (Markdown, Code, etc.)** (green arrow pointing to \"Markdown\"):\r\n",
    "    - This dropdown allows you to change the type of a selected cell. The two main types are:\r\n",
    "        - **Code**: Cells that contain code, which will be executed when run.\r\n",
    "        - **Markdown**: Cells used to write formatted text, explanations, and LaTeX equations. These cells do not run code but are useful for documentation.\r\n",
